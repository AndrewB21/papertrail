# PaperTrail

PaperTrail is a web application to track your anime watch history for use with the Refold language learning system. Keep track of what you're currently watching, what you want to watch, and what you have already finished. Browse for new anime and track your daily time spent immersing yourself in native Japanese content to further your language studies.
